# OpenPump: Automated Peristaltic Pump Control

OpenPump contains both hardware and software files for creating an automated peristaltic pump system. Powered by an ESP32 microcontroller, OpenPump operates based on sensor feedback, such as detecting water levels. The pump runs until the sensor confirms the desired condition is met. Ideal for DIY enthusiasts and automation projects, OpenPump offers an open-source solution for precise fluid control.
